# n-queens
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

# The problem in a nutshell
Given an n x n chessboard, how many different ways can you place n queens, such that none of them are attacking each other?

# For your consideration
Pondering the following questions (in order) will help you conceptualize a solution:

Given an n x n chessboard, how would you place n rooks such that none of them are attacking each other?
Given an n x n chessboard, how many different ways can you place n rooks, such that none of them are attacking each other?

You'll run into some questions like this (but easier) during some interviews, and during your day-to-day work. This repo is a playground for thinking about this kind of problem.
